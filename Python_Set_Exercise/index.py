# Exercise 1: Add a list of elements to a set
# sample_set = {"Yellow", "Orange", "Black"}
# sample_list = ["Blue", "Green", "Red"]
# sample_set.update(sample_list)
# print(sample_set)

# Exercise 2: Return a new set of identical items from two sets
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# inter = set1.intersection(set2)
# print(inter)

# Exercise 3: Get Only unique items from two sets
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# set3 = set1.union(set2)
# print(set3)

# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Exercise 4: Update the first set with items that don’t exist in the second set

# set1 = {10, 20, 30}
# set2 = {20, 40, 50}
# set1.difference_update(set2)
# print(set1)

# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Exercise 5: Remove items from the set at once
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set1.difference_update({10,20,30})
# print(set1)

# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Exercise 6: Return a set of elements present in Set A or B, but not both

# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
# res = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
# print(res)

# ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Exercise 7: Check if two sets have any elements in common. If yes, display the common elements

# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {60, 70, 80, 90, 10}
# if set1.isdisjoint(set2):
#     print("Two sets have no items in common")
# else:
#     print("Two sets have items in common")
#     print(set1.intersection(set2))

# Exercise 8: Update set1 by adding items from set2, except common items
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}

# Exercise 9: Remove items from set1 that are not common to both set1 and set2
# set1 = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set2 = {30, 40, 50, 60, 70}
